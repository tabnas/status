# ci/

Staging area for GitHub Actions workflow changes.

This directory exists because session credentials cannot write
`.github/workflows/*` — see admin `DECISIONS.md` ADR-8. To change CI:

1. Put the intended workflow file in `workflows/`.
2. A maintainer promotes it with the admin `rollout/apply-ci-folders.sh`
   script.

## Promoted, 2026-09-22

`workflows/docs.yml`, the whole prose gate (`npm test`, then Vale and
the recorded counts), is now `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, moved by the
rollout script rather than edited. Nothing is pending. Read the workflow
itself rather than a description of it here.
